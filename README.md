# shared-house_wordpress_plugin
Wordpress plugin for <a href="www.shared-house.com">Shared-house.com</a> booking calendar

This plugin displays the booking calendar of shared-house.com website on a wordpress site.

The user has to fill the ad # (previously created on shared-house.com) to display the right calendar.

Currently it's only possible to include one calendar on a wordpress site through this plugin.

Resources:
- The home page of the plugin in wordpress plugin directory can be found here:
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/shared-house/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/shared-house/</a>

- The equivalent plugin for joomla websites can be found here:
<a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/profile/extension/vertical-markets/booking-a-reservations/shared-house">http://extensions.joomla.org/profile/extension/vertical-markets/booking-a-reservations/shared-house</a>

- The homepage for the calendar (documentation, FAQ, download...) is here:
<a href=http://www.shared-house.com/free-booking-calendar.php">http://www.shared-house.com/free-booking-calendar.php</a>



Todo:
- Allow the possibility to have several calendars on one site through the plugin
- Allow the possibility (as of the Joomla plugin) to link to an internal page instead of the standard (external) calendar page
